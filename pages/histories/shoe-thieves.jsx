        <p>Down 2-0 against the Dallas Steaks in the divisional round, ace pitcher Matteo Prestige initiated the reverse sweep with a 7-0 shutout. In the Good League Championship series, the Flowers couldnâ€™t score against Matteo on <Jump season={2} day={107}>Day 107</Jump> either, letting the Shoe Thieves face the undefeated Philly Pies in the Internet Series. On <Jump season={2} day={108}>Day 108</Jump>, the Shoe Thieves gave the Pies their first-ever playoff loss, before losing the series 1-3. Matteo was the only pitcher who did not get to play the champions, ending with a pristine 0.00 career postseason ERA.</p>
