          During a game against the Breath Mints, the Shoe Thieves‚Äô best pitcher Matteo Prestige was tragically Incinerated, after having an allergic reaction on <Jump time="2020-08-05T22:22:50Z">Day 52</Jump>. To add insult to injury, their replacement was 0 star pitcher Gunther O‚ÄôBrian. Gunther immediately claimed the title of worst pitcher in the League by blowing a 6-3 lead into a 16-21 defeat, setting a new record for most runs scored in a game. It‚Äôs üòî okay. Gunther later became a fan favorite, and the community celebrated their shutout on <Jump season={6} day={22}>Season 6, Day 22</Jump> as the first of many.

          The Shoe Thieves‚Äô history has been marked by a Curse, exclusively Feedbacking Charleston‚Äôs best players in exchange for much worse replacements. Fate seemed to take a turn when reality flickered and sent Lachlan Shelton back to Canada in exchange for their best batter, Eugenia Garbage. But the Curse was quickly reinstalled when Feedback hit Eugenia <Jump time="2020-09-23T11:19:21Z">a second time in the same game</Jump>; now up to bat was 1 star batter Simon Haley, somehow the Moist Talkers‚Äô only batter worse than Lachlan.

          In Season 9, three teams were in the run for Ascension: the Philly Pies, swept by the Thieves to steal their #1 playoff spot on <Jump season={9} day={99}>Day 99</Jump>; the Tigers, met and matched in <Jump season={9} day={106}>the divisional series</Jump>; and finally the Baltimore Crabs, the only team they had never faced. With Nagomi McDaniel <Jump time="2020-10-10T13:12:50Z">recently unshelled</Jump>, Thieves tying the series was already a surprise. In game 5, down 2 runs at the bottom of the 9th, Stu Trololol‚Äôs clutch factor came in for a legendary 3-run home run.

          Ever since the <Jump redirect="/offseason" time="2020-08-30T19:15:00Z">Season 4 election</Jump> when they were equipped with the Grappling Hook, Richardson Games had been quite an anomaly: low batting and pitching stars, but excelling in baserunning and defense. While this should be enough to satiate any reasonable player, becoming a Siphon in the <Jump redirect="/offseason" time="2020-10-11T19:15:00Z">Season 9 election</Jump> made Richardson hungry for blood. In season 10, they would go from 5.5 to an absurd 8 defense stars by sipping the entire League. Notable victims included beloved Magic player <Jump time="2020-10-14T22:13:10Z">Chorby Short</Jump> and the very player who <Jump time="2020-08-28T12:27:30Z">originally swapped teams</Jump> with Richardson, <Jump time="2020-10-13T22:07:10Z">Ren Hunter</Jump>.

          In the <Jump redirect="/offseason" time="2020-10-18T19:30:00Z">Season 10 election</Jump>, the Gods were particularly generous to the Shoe Thieves, granting them five Blessings. Among these were the infamous Noise-Canceling Headphones, the Traveling team modification, and the mysterious ‚ÄúHaunt a random player‚Äù. The initial surprise of Esme Ramsey becoming ‚ÄúHaunted‚Äù was nowhere near the fans‚Äô collective shock when, on their first plate appearance, Esme instead left their place to none other than Atlas Jonbois, ghost of a renowned Shoe Thief who survived less than three days in the League in Season 3, from <Jump time="2020-08-05T10:19:15Z">Day 40</Jump> to <Jump time="2020-08-05T13:29:50Z">Day 43</Jump>.

A departure as sudden as <Jump redirect="/leaderboard" time="2020-10-16T20:04:19Z">their arrival</Jump>, with the mysterious Tad Seeth disappearing from their shadows simultaneously.
